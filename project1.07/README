Dungeon Game - Now With Less Dungeon!

The dungeon game is going under major changes.  Until the changes are complete, the program will simply load the types
of monsters from the file in ~/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt, then display it on the screen.  The monster class has been
partially updated to handle the new types of information.  There is now a dice_set class to simulate a set of dice.
