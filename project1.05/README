The dungeon game now allows YOU to play it.  Use the numpad (with or without Num Lock) to move the PC.  Or you can use
the keys defined in the PDF provided by Jeremy (I use a Dvorak keyboard layout, so those are useless for me).  Use S to
"save" the game (i.e. quit without saving).  Use > and < to go up and down stairs.  Space or 5 will cause the PC to do
nothing for the turn.  Press m to list the monsters.  This list is scrollable if it is too long to fit on one page.
Use the arrow keys to scroll up and down.  Use escape to exit the monster list.

Usage:
    bin/main [--save] [--load] [--nummon #]

    --save      Generates a dungeon and saves it to ~/.rlg327/dungeon
    --load      Loads a saved dungeon from ~/.rlg327/dungeon
    --nummon    Specifies the number of monsters to generate in the dungeon.  Warning, if this number is too high the
                game will be stuck in an infinite loop.
