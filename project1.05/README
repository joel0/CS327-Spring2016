The dungeon game now allows YOU to play it.  Use the numpad (with or without Num Lock) to move the PC.  Or you can use
the keys defined in the PDF provided by Jeremy (I use a Dvorak keyboard layout, so those are useless for me).  Use S to
"save" the game (i.e. quit without saving).  Use > and < to go up and down stairs.  Space or 5 will cause the PC to do
nothing for the turn.

Usage:
    bin/main [--save] [--load] [--nummon #]

    --save      Generates a dungeon and saves it to ~/.rlg327/dungeon
    --load      Loads a saved dungeon from ~/.rlg327/dungeon
    --nummon    Specifies the number of monsters to generate in the dungeon.  Warning, if this number is too high the
                game will be stuck in an infinite loop.
