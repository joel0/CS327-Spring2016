Dungeon Game Now Items Do Things!

The Dungeon Game has been expanded to allow you to pick up items and equip them.
Equipping them increases your attack damage.  The items have other properties
that could affect combat, visibilty, or locomotion, but the I did not implement
any of those because they are not required by the assignment description (and
it's almost 1 AM).  When an NPC wants to occupy a position occupid by another
NPC, the one in the destination gets shoved to a random adjacent location that
does not contain a monster or wall.  I created a message queue to display
events, such as combat and item actions.  Each message requires being dismissed
by pressing a key.  The message queue's behavior is fairly annoying and could be
improved, but it functions well enough right now.

The PC has an inventory and equipment he's currently wearing.  He can equip one
of each wearable item (except rings, where two are allowed).  He can remove an
item to his inventory.  He can expunge an item from the game.
