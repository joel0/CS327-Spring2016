Dungeon Game Now with Fog of War

The game is now partially in C++.  The behavior did not change at all in the C++ transition.  The new front-end feature
is Fog of War.  The PC can only see a rectangle of up to three spaces away in each direction.  He can remember the
part of the dungeon that he has seen, but he does not remember any monsters.  Rock blocks the PC's vision.
