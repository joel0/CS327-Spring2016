This is a simple dungeon generation.  There are parameters defined in
src/main.h for the number of rooms (min and max), size of rooms (min and max).

Room Generation
Rooms are generated by randomly placing a room within the dungeon's bounds
(excluding the border).  The room is checked for validity against all existing
rooms.

Corridor Plotting
The corridor plotting is done by finding the desired direction (of 45 degree
increments).  If the direction is not orthaganal, the chosen direction is
alternated.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Compile by running make
2. Execute bin/main
