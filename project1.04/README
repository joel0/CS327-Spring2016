Dungeon Now with Enemies

The dungeon game now has enemies who can interact with the PC.  The PC himself can move (randomly).  The enemies will
move according to their properties when I get that feature implemented.  The enemies (and PC) move in the appropriate
order.  Killing other characters should work, but is untested.  I have a hard coded seed for
development.

Usage:
    bin/main [--save] [--load] [--nummon #]

    --save      Generates a dungeon and saves it to ~/.rlg327/dungeon
    --load      Loads a saved dungeon from ~/.rlg327/dungeon
    --nummon    Specifies the number of monsters to generate in the dungeon.  Warning, if this number is too high the
                game will be stuck in an infinite loop.
