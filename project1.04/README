Dungeon Now with Enemies

The dungeon game now has enemies who can interact with the PC.  The PC himself can move (randomly).  The enemies will
move according to their properties.  A character (monster or PC) kills another character when trying to move to the same
cell.  The monsters and PC must bore holes through the walls, which makes the characters appear to go a turn without
moving.  The output is printed after each PC turn.  For debugging, when a character takes his turn, a message saying
who moved is printed out.  There are debugging headers enabled, which prints the seed, a list of rooms, and the
monsters.

Usage:
    bin/main [--save] [--load] [--nummon #]

    --save      Generates a dungeon and saves it to ~/.rlg327/dungeon
    --load      Loads a saved dungeon from ~/.rlg327/dungeon
    --nummon    Specifies the number of monsters to generate in the dungeon.  Warning, if this number is too high the
                game will be stuck in an infinite loop.
