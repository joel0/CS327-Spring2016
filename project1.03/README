Dungeon Generation with Distance Calculation

Usage: main [--load] [--save]

    --load  loads ~/.rlg327/dungeon
    --save  generated a dungeon and saves it to the disk at ~/.rlg327/dungeon

This version of the dungeon game generates a dungeon or loads one from the disk based on the arguments.  It prints the
see and list of rooms (mainly for debugging; will be removed in a few versions).  Then three maps are printed.  The
first is the standard map of hallways and corridors.  The second is the distance map for monsters that can tunnel
through walls.  The third is the distance map for monsters that must stay within rooms and corridors.
