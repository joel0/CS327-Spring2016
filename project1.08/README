Dungeon Game Now With Items, Config Files, and color!

The dungeon game has been expanded to have two config files.

~/.rlg327/item_descrip.txt contains the description for possible items.  I am
not sure how the two handed items are exactly specified, so that has not been
tested. I was not sure whether the instructions were saying that the damage
bonus should remain as dice or be converted to an int on item generation.  I
left it as dice.

~/.rlg327/monster_descrip.txt contains the description for possible monsters.

The game now generates monsters from the config file.  The dice are rolled to
calculate the necessary values, excluding the damage value.

The monsters and items have colors.  Black is displayed as white so it's
visible.  The monster list displays colors, but black and white are displayed
as black there because of the white background.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. make
